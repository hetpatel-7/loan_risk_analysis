# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction & Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of **20,000 loan applicants** to solve a critical financial problem: **identifying risky borrowers before they default.** By applying data mining and machine learning techniques in **R**, this project moves beyond simple analysis to actionable insights, helping financial institutions minimize risk and target the right customer segments.

## 🚀 Key Features & Methodologies

### 1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing
- **Deep Dive Visualization:** Uncovered a specific **"Danger Zone"** (High Loan Amount + Low Income) where defaults are concentrated.
- **Demographic Risk Matrix:** Heatmaps revealing that specific combinations (e.g., *Unemployed & Single*) carry significantly higher default probabilities.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, scaled numerical features, and engineered factors for modeling.

### 2. 🔗 Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)
- **Goal:** To understand *why* people default.
- **Innovation:** Utilized **Cluster-Based Binning** (derived from K-Means) to create natural categories for Income and Credit Score instead of arbitrary cuts.
- **Result:** Discovered deterministic rules (Confidence = 1.0) identifying specific profiles that have a 100% historical default rate.

### 3. 🤖 Classification (Supervised Learning)
- **Goal:** Predict if a *new* applicant will default (Binary Classification).
- **Models Compared:**
  - **Logistic Regression:** Adjusted thresholds to handle class imbalance (80/20 split).
  - **Decision Tree (CART):** The top-performing model.
- **Performance:** Achieved **89% Accuracy** and **87% Precision** with the Decision Tree model.

### 4. 🧩 Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Goal:** Market Segmentation & Risk Profiling.
- **Techniques:** - **K-Means:** Segmented users by *Income vs. Credit Score* to find "Wealthy but Risky" applicants.
  - **CLARA:** Used for *Income vs. Loan Amount* to robustly identify "Big Spenders" vs. "Micro-borrowers" without being skewed by outliers.
  - **Risk-Based Pricing:** Analyzed *Credit Score vs. Interest Rate* to verify if the bank follows risk-based pricing standards.

## 📸 Key Insights (Visuals)

> *Note: These are descriptions of the plots generated by the R script.*

* **The "Risk Matrix":** A heatmap showing that Marital Status and Employment Status have a compounded effect on default risk.
* **Customer Personas:** Clustering revealed distinct groups, such as the *"High-Risk, High-Demand"* segment (Low Credit Score, High Loan Request).

## 💻 How to Run This Project

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/loan-risk-analysis.git](https://github.com/yourusername/loan-risk-analysis.git)
    ```
2.  **Install Required Packages**
    Open `loan_analysis.R` and run the setup block at the top. The script checks for missing libraries and installs them automatically.
    ```r
    if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse")
    # ... (other packages are auto-installed)
    ```
3.  **Run the Script**
    Run the entire script in RStudio. The output will generate:
    * Console output for model metrics and rules.
    * Plots in the "Plots" pane (which can be saved as PNGs).

## 📈 Future Improvements
* **Random Forest:** Implementing a Random Forest model to improve Recall on the minority class (Defaults).
* **Shiny App:** Building an interactive dashboard to let loan officers input applicant data and get a real-time risk score.
* **SMOTE:** Advanced data balancing techniques to further handle the 80/20 class imbalance.
